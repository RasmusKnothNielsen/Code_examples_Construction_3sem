# Observer Pattern

A behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects
about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

Definition:
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.

Real world example: While you subscribe to a magazine, you will receive it by the mail every time it is printed.
As long as you keep being subscribed, it will happen automatically. When you unsubscribe, it will stop being sent to you.

Here are some examples of the pattern in core Java libraries:

    java.util.Observer/java.util.Observable (rarely used in real world)
    All implementations of java.util.EventListener (practically all over Swing components)
    javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionBindingListener
    javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener
    javax.faces.event.PhaseListener

###Design Principle:
-   Low Coupling

###Identification: 
The pattern can be recognized by subscription methods, 
that store objects in a list and by calls to the update method issued to objects in that list.
Furthermore there has to be an update method in the observer object.

### Why is Observable/Observer deprecated:
Observable/Observer has been deprecated since Java 9.

- Not Serializable - Since, Observable doesn't implements Serializable. 
So, you can't Serialize Observable neither its subclass.

- No Thread Safety - The methods can be overridden by its subclasses, 
and event notification can occur in different orders and possibly on different threads, 
which is enough to disrupt any "thread safety".

What are the alternatives? :

- You can use PropertyChangeEvent and PropertyChangeListener from java.beans package.
