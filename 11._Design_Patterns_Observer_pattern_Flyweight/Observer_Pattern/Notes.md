# Observer Pattern

A behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects
about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

Definition:
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are
notified and updated automatically.

Real world example: While you subscribe to a magazine, you will receive it by the mail every time it is printed.
As long as you keep being subscribed, it will happen automatically. When you unsubscribe, it will stop being sent to you.

###Design Principle:
-   Loose Coupling.
